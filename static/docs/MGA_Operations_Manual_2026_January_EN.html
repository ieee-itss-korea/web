<!-- SECTION 9.7 -->
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h1>9.7 Chapters</h1>
<hr>

<h2>A. Definition</h2>
<p>A Chapter is a Society subdivision belonging to a Region, one or more Sections, or a Geographic Council. There are single Society Chapters, joint Society Chapters, and Technical Council Chapters. A Chapter is composed of a minimum of twelve voting IEEE Society members (multiple Societies in the case of a joint Chapter), petitioning the relevant parent geographic organizational unit and technical organizational unit for formation, to carry out the mission of IEEE. For Technical Council Chapters, a minimum of twelve voting IEEE members of the Societies belonging to the Technical Council in the parent geographic unit must petition the geographic unit and the Technical Council.</p>
<p>An IEEE member at the Graduate Student Member, Member, Senior Member, or Fellow grade who is a member of an IEEE Society and who belongs to the geographic unit in which the Society has a Technical Chapter is considered a member of the Chapter.</p>
<p>References to "Chapter" in Section 9.7 apply to both Chapters and joint Chapters.</p>
<ol>
<li>An IEEE Technical Society Chapter carries out activities within the scope of the technical field of the sponsoring Society. An IEEE Technical Council Chapter carries out activities within the scope of the technical field of the Technical Council.</li>
<li>Chapters function in a manner similar to the committee of the applicable Section/Council.</li>
<li>Where the geographic scope of a Section/Council warrants and where interest among Society members is sufficient to form more than one Chapter, additional Chapters may be organized and operated under a suitably different name in accordance with currently applicable procedures.</li>
</ol>

<h2>B. Chapter Formation</h2>
<h3>1. Petition Procedure</h3>
<p>A petition for Chapter formation shall include:</p>
<p class="indent">a. Name of the Section(s)</p>

<!-- SECTION 9.13 -->
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h1>9.13 Geographic Unit Elections</h1>
<hr>

<p>In IEEE volunteer activities, it is routine that officers be replaced in an orderly and regular fashion, ensuring a healthy flow of new ideas and the vitality of geographic units. This section of the Operations Manual defines the processes and procedures that IEEE geographic units (Councils, Sections, Chapters, Affinity Groups) shall follow for elections.</p>
<p>All elections shall be conducted with the highest degree of integrity. The responsibility for maintaining fair and transparent election practices rests with the candidates, the organizational unit conducting the election, officers, staff, volunteers, and all committees managing/overseeing the election process.</p>
<p>The MGA Nominations Tool within vTools is available for use by Sections and Chapters and <b>shall be utilized for conducting elections except where prohibited by local law</b>. Access: <a href="https://nominations.vtools.ieee.org/home">https://nominations.vtools.ieee.org/home</a></p>
<div class="change-note">[2026 change] MGA Nominations Tool usage changed from "recommended" to "shall be utilized" (mandatory), and Chapters were added to the scope.</div>
<p>All individuals participating in the election process must familiarize themselves with the following IEEE Policy sections: Section 13.3 Elections and Electioneering, Section 13.3.A.2 Election Code of Conduct, and Section 7.8 IEEE Code of Ethics.</p>
<div class="change-note">[2026 change] "Candidate's Code of Principles" renamed to "Election Code of Conduct."</div>

<h3>Key Election Dates:</h3>
<p class="indent">a. All geographic units are encouraged to begin elections as early as possible. All elections must begin by <b>August 1</b> and be completed by <b>December 15</b> of each year.</p>

<p class="indent2">ii. Be active as of <b>June 30</b> and maintain continuous membership through the close of the election.</p>
<p class="indent">c. The election date is the first day the ballot is open for voting, and the close of the election is the day the ballot closes.</p>

<div class="change-note">[2026 new] Regarding Section elections, the Region Director, in consultation with the Past Region Director and Region Director Elect, may take the following actions to ensure Sections comply with the geographic unit election process:
<ul>
<li>Direct a Section to conduct an election and specify a deadline for completion.</li>
<li>Form a Nominations and Elections Committee composed of members from the Section or Region to conduct an election on behalf of the Section.</li>
<li>Direct a Section to suspend or halt an election and require corrective action or restart of the election.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>A. Nominations and Elections Committee</h2>
<p>Each geographic unit shall appoint an annual Nominations and Elections Committee composed of members of the geographic unit. The committee must be approved by the geographic unit ExCom.</p>
<h3>1. Composition</h3>
