## Abstract

The rapid growth in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving systems (ADS) has created an urgent need for efficient, repeatable, and comprehensive safety evaluation methods. Vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) testing has emerged as a promising approach that bridges the gap between simulation and real-world validation. By immersing a physical vehicle into a closed-loop virtual traffic environment, VIL enables robust, repeatable, and safe evaluation of ADAS and ADS features.

This presentation will provide an overview of VIL testing methodologies, highlighting their ability to capture full-vehicle dynamics and real-time interactions with simulated environments through advanced sensor stimulation. Applications of VIL in current research, relevant standards and protocols, and emerging directions will be discussed.
