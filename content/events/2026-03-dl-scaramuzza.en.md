## Abstract

Robots play a crucial role in inspection, agriculture, logistics, autonomous driving, and search-and-rescue missions. However, they still lag behind humans in speed, versatility, and robustness. This talk will show how combining model-based and machine learning techniques with the capabilities of novel low-latency sensors (e.g., event cameras) can enable autonomous systems — such as drones, legged robots, robotic arms, and cars — to achieve improved agility and robustness. This will lead to better productivity and safety for future autonomous systems.
